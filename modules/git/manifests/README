To install git on your node, you can just 

  include git

Installation of gitlab is based on 
https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/stable/doc/installation.md

For gitlab / gitolite to work, you will need to create an rsa keypair
put them somewhere puppet can find them and tell the module where
they are when you include the class in your node definition. 
For example:

  class {'git::gitlab':
             pubkey  => "puppet:///files/gitlab-id_rsa.pub",
             privkey => "puppet:///files/gitlab-id_rsa"
  }
